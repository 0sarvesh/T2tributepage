        <span>Muhammad Ali</span>, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in
        Louisville, Kentucky, was one of the most iconic and influential figures
        in the world of sports and beyond. Renowned for his charismatic
        personality and remarkable boxing skills, Ali rose to fame as the
        three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the world. His famous
        catchphrase, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," epitomized his
        unique blend of speed, agility, and power in the ring. Beyond his boxing
        prowess, Ali was a social and political activist, passionately
        advocating for civil rights and conscientiously objecting to the Vietnam
        War, which led to his temporary suspension from boxing. His resilience
        and unwavering principles, both inside and outside the ring, made him a
        global symbol of courage and conviction. Muhammad Ali's legacy as an
        athlete and a champion for justice continues to inspire generations
        worldwide.
